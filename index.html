      To make the code work, we still need to apply this CSS (above) to your
      HTML document:
    </p>
    <ul>
      Orange
    </ul>
    <ul>
      Apple
    </ul>
    <ul>
      Banana
    </ul>
    <ul>
      Grapes
    </ul>
    <ul>
      Pineapple
    </ul>
    <p>
      If your paragraph text is red, congratulations! Your CSS is working.
      Anatomy of a CSS rulese Let's dissect the CSS code for red paragraph text
      to understand how it works. To the right of the property—after the
      colon—there is the property value. This chooses one out of many possible
      appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many color
      values in addition to red.)

      To make the code work, we still need to apply this
      <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/CSS_basics"
        target="_blank"
        >CSS</a
      >
      (above) to your HTML document. Otherwise, the styling won't change the
      appearance of the HTML. (If you haven't been following our project, pause
      here to read Dealing with files and HTML basics.)
